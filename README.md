# 3018 Knowledge Base

I received a [Sainsmart Genmitsu 3018 Pro CNC Mill](https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/cnc-machines/products/sainsmart-genmitsu-cnc-router-pro-diy-kit) for Christmas 2020.  This repo is intended to capture things information about the mill and documentation on upgrades that I make.  Purchased part upgrades have links provided, and design infomation for custom design upgrades is captured either in this repo or is linked from this repo.

# General Upgrades
* [Sainsmart Enclosure](https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/genmitsu-cnc-replacement-upgrade-parts/products/genmitsu-kaba-desktop-cnc-enclosure)
  * This was probably the most valuable accessory to have for the 3018.  
  * Milling is a dusty, dirty process, and not very quiet.  The enclosure helps with the noise a bit, but it absolutely reuqired for dust containment.  When a laser is used, it also contains the smoke pretty well.
 
* Enclosure Modifications
  * Power pass through grommit
  * USB pass through
  * Rear cover, magnets
* Isolation Pad
* [CNCjs](https://cnc.js.org/) on Raspi
  * Raspi mount box
  * Future: Camera mount
