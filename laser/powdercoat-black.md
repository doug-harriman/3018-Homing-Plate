## Tape Test

* Used 2x layers of Scotch® Exterior Surface Painter’s Tape 2097.  This is a plastic tape.
* Attempted to laser cut the star image.  Even with multiple passes (800 mm/s, 80% power) did not get fully clean cut.
* Filled with powder coat & cured.
* Removed tape.  Did not get really clean edges due to poor laser cut of plastic tape.
